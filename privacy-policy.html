                                    <p>Quantitatives, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Quantitatives,” “Company,” “us,” or
                                    “we”), provides www.Quantitatives.com and the other websites under the
                                    Quantitatives.com domain (collectively, the “Sites”), and our SaaS product, web
                                    design software, tools, and related services (together with the Sites, the
                                    “Service”) subject to your compliance with all the terms, conditions, and notices
                                    contained or referenced herein (the “Terms of Service” or the “Agreement”).</p>  

                                    <p>We've tried hard to keep this Agreement as readable and straightforward as possible.
                                    We’ve also added a series of short explanations of the legal language in plain
                                    English (they all start with "Basically...") to aid in understanding, but that part
                                    isn’t legally binding. If you have suggestions that can help us improve it or any
                                    questions about this Agreement, please email us and let us know. This Agreement
                                    explains our obligations to you, and your obligations to us. Except as noted
                                    otherwise below, this Agreement is the entire Agreement between us. By using the
                                    Sites and the Service in any way, you are agreeing to comply with these Terms of
                                    Service, our Global Privacy Policy, EU & Swiss Privacy Policy, our Template
                                    Submission Guidelines, and any other legal notices or conditions or guidelines
                                    posted on the Sites.</p> 

                                    <p>If you have questions regarding this Agreement or about Quantitatives, please
                                    contact us by email at contact@quantitatives.com.</p> 


                                    <h3>2. Acknowledgement and acceptance of terms</h3> 

                                    <p>In addition, when using the Service, you shall be subject to any posted guidelines
                                    or rules applicable to the Service that may contain terms and conditions in addition
                                    to those in the Terms of Service. By using the Service or accessing the Sites, you
                                    agree to the Terms of Service, the Global Privacy Policy, which is incorporated
                                    herein by reference, the EU & Swiss Privacy Policy, and the Template Submission
                                    Guidelines. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

                                    <p>Our Service may integrate with other services on a number of platforms provided by
                                    third parties, including Ecommerce Payment Processors (as defined below). Please be
                                    aware that your activities on each of these platforms may be subject to additional
                                    terms of service for that particular platform.</p>

                                    <p>Certain parts of the Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions
                                    specified by us from time to time; your use of such Service is subject to those
                                    additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into these Terms of Service
                                    by this reference. Prices of the Service are subject to change upon 30 days’ notice
                                    from us. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the
                                    Quantitatives Site or the Service itself. Quantitatives shall not be liable to you
                                    or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension, or
                                    discontinuance of the Service.</p>

                                    <p>Please review our terms, as you must agree to them to use Quantitatives.</p>

                                    <p>You should also review our Global Privacy Policy, EU & Swiss Privacy Policy, and our</p>
                                    Template Submission Guidelines.</p> 

                                    <p>We may change our terms of service or our pricing from time to time. If we do, we'll
                                    post a note on our website or email you.</p> 

                                    <p>If you integrate any of the Quantitatives services with a third-party service (e.g.
                                    Stripe), you should review their terms of service because you might need to agree to
                                    additional or different terms.</p> 


                                    <h3>3. Eligibility</h3> 

                                    <p>The Service is available only for individuals aged 13 years or older. If you are age
                                    13 or older but under the age of 18, or the legal age of majority where you reside
                                    if that jurisdiction has an older age of majority, then you agree to review these
                                    Terms of Service with your parent or guardian to make sure that both you and your
                                    parent or guardian understand and agree to these Terms of Service. You agree to have
                                    your parent or guardian review and accept these Terms of Service on your behalf. If
                                    you are a parent or guardian agreeing to these Terms of Service for the benefit of a
                                    child over the age of 13, then you agree to and accept full responsibility for that
                                    child’s use of the Service, including all financial charges and legal liability that
                                    he or she may incur. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to
                                    any person or entity and change the eligibility criteria for using the Service at
                                    any time. The right to access the Service is revoked where these Terms of Service or
                                    use of the Service is prohibited or to the extent offering, sale, or provision of
                                    the Service conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation.</p>

                                    <p>If you are entering into these Terms of Service on behalf of a company or other
                                    legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its
                                    affiliates, and all users who access the Service through your account to these Terms
                                    of Service, in which case the terms “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity, its
                                    affiliates, and users associated with it. If you do not have such authority, or if
                                    you do not agree with these Terms of Service, you must not accept these Terms of
                                    Service and you may not use the Service. You further agree that you assume all
                                    responsibility and liability in connection with your use of the Service on behalf of
                                    such a company or other legal entity, and you shall be solely responsible for all
                                    disputes, if any, that arise due to your use of the Service on behalf of such a
                                    company or other legal entity.</p>

                                    <p>You must be at least 13 (and have your parent's permission if you are under 18) to
                                    use Quantitatives.</p>

                                    If you’re using Quantitatives on behalf of your business, make sure you're
                                    authorized to agree to our terms of service on its behalf.</p>


                                    <h3>4. Account information</h3>  

                                    <p>Registering for an account. To use the Service, you will need to register and create
                                    an account (including your full name, password, and email address). If you upgrade
                                    your account, you will need to provide payment information as well. Quantitatives
                                    accounts will give you access to the Service and functionality that we may establish
                                    and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different
                                    types of accounts for different types of users. If you open a Quantitatives account
                                    on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you
                                    and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized
                                    representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this
                                    Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. By
                                    connecting to Quantitatives with a third-party service, you give us permission to
                                    access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and
                                    to store your login credentials for that service. For more information on the types
                                    of information we collect from these third-party services, please read our Global
                                    Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to reclaim usernames on behalf of businesses or
                                    individuals that hold legal claim or trademark on those usernames.</p>

                                    <p>Your responsibility for your account. You are responsible for taking all steps to
                                    ensure that no unauthorized person shall have access to your account or password.
                                    When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. We
                                    encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper-
                                    and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols) with your account. It is your sole
                                    responsibility to: (i) control the dissemination and use of your account and
                                    password, and (ii) promptly inform us of any need to deactivate an account or
                                    password. We are not liable for any harm related to the theft of passwords, or your
                                    disclosure of passwords. You shall immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of
                                    your account or password or any breach of confidentiality. You are solely
                                    responsible for any damage resulting from the use of your account and username. You
                                    may not use your account or password to breach security of another account.
                                    How to control your account. You may control your account and how you interact with
                                    the Service by changing your settings. By providing us with your email address, you
                                    consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices,

                                    <p>You need to sign up for an account to use Quantitatives. Choose a plan that works
                                    for you or for your company (if you're authorized to act on their behalf). If you
                                    set up an account through another service like Google, it’s OK for us to use your
                                    information as provided by that service.</p>

                                    <p>Keep your password safe and let us know if you detect any unusual behavior on your

                                    <h3>6. User Content</h3> 

                                    <p>We may now or in the future allow you to post or publish content on or upload
                                    content to the Service, including but not limited to website templates created and
                                    contributed by you, blog or forum posts, images, and photos. Any content a user

                                    Intellectual Property Rights (defined below) therein, is referred to as “User

                                    with the Template Submission Guidelines. You retain ownership of your User Content.
                                    We have no obligation to store, maintain, or provide you a copy of your User
                                    Content. You alone are responsible for any of your User Content that may be lost or

                                    <p>For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent

                                    <p>You own all of the User Content you post or publish (“post”) on the Service. You
                                    grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, transferable, sub-licensable,
                                    worldwide license to use, modify, reproduce, display, and distribute your User
                                    Content on the Service for the purposes of operating and providing the Service to
                                    you and other users (“User Content License”). You understand and agree that the
                                    Service is a public platform and other users may search for, see, use, and/or

                                    <p>We may allow you to post, publish, or upload content to our Service. If you do this,
                                    you will own your content, but we get a license to anything you upload to the
                                    Service. Any feedback sent to Quantitatives is owned by Quantitatives and can be
                                    used or distributed by Quantitatives in any manner and without cost.</p>


                                    <h3>7. Rules</h3>  

                                    <p>Quantitatives is a “service provider” to you, and you are a “customer” of our
                                    Services irrespective of whether you pay fees to obtain the Services. Any natural
                                    persons accessing or using your Quantitatives account, the websites, pages,
                                    features, or content created by you on our Services are deemed your “End Users.”
                                    Quantitatives does not have a direct relationship with any of your End Users,
                                    therefore Quantitatives is not responsible for how you handle End User information.</p>

                                    <p>Applicable laws. You may have additional obligations under local law other than
                                    those described in this Terms of Service, particularly if you or your End Users are
                                    located outside of the United States. Such obligations may be more restrictive than
                                    this Terms of Service. Use of the Services does not ensure compliance with such
                                    laws, nor is Quantitatives responsible for your compliance with such laws. To the
                                    extent Quantitatives has any obligations to assist you with handling End User
                                    information, such obligations are enumerated within a Data Processing Agreement
                                    executed between Quantitatives and you.</p>

                                    <p>Security safeguards. You will use all reasonable efforts to protect information
                                    collected from End Users via your use of the Services, including any personal
                                    information obtained from unauthorized access or use. In the event you discover that
                                    the End User information collected by you has been breached, compromised, or
                                    inadvertently exposed to non-authorized third parties, you shall notify
                                    Quantitatives promptly of such a breach or exposure including the root cause,
                                    remediation steps, and compensating controls to ensure such a breach does not occur
                                    in the future.</p>

                                    <p>Security notification. You are responsible for providing notification to your End
                                    Users, third parties, or authorities under the applicable breach notification
                                    statutes and any other applicable data protection laws. You acknowledge that you are
                                    solely responsible for any personal injury or property damage arising from or
                                    relating to your use of any Services.</p>

                                    <p>Privacy. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for providing any
                                    required notices and obtaining all required consents from End Users in connection
                                    with any use of the Services. Your notice and consent must be compliant with all
                                    applicable data protection and security laws and regulations. Without limiting the
                                    foregoing, before collecting or using any End User information, you must provide
                                    adequate notice of the End User information you collect, how it will be used and/or
                                    shared, and obtain any necessary consents required under the applicable data
                                    protection laws and regulations. You agree to comply with all data protection laws
                                    and regulations (including those applying to personal information) in connection
                                    with your access and use of the Services.</p> 

                                    <p>Notice. You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your use of the Services
                                    that: (i) complies with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, (ii) is
                                    conspicuously displayed to all End Users, and (iii) clearly and accurately describes
                                    to End Users what information you collect (such as login information, contact form
                                    data, cookies, etc.) and how you use and share such information (including for
                                    marketing and advertising) with Quantitatives and other third parties.</p> 

                                    <p>Privacy rights. You will respond to any End Users wishing to exercise their privacy
                                    rights, under the applicable law, as it relates to any information collected via
                                    your use of the Services. For example, if End Users located in certain jurisdictions
                                    may exercise a “right to be forgotten” (or “erasure”) to the information you have
                                    collected about them, you shall comply with their request as required by applicable
                                    law. For clarity, you are directly responsible (or, the “data controller”) for the
                                    information processed by your use of the Services, including any information
                                    processed via third-party applications available on the Services. Quantitatives is
                                    not a data controller to such information and is not responsible for responding to
                                    End Users on your behalf. To the extent Quantitatives receives a request from an End
                                    User or authority about your use of the Services, Quantitatives will notify you as
                                    permitted by law.</p>
